            <strong>In-Universe Narrative:</strong>
            <p class="mb-0 small text-muted">
                This album is presented as a "live" recording from its respective venue (e.g., The Crucible or The Norfolk Scope). The tracklist, banter, and crowd energy reflect the band's story at that specific moment in time.
            </p>

            <strong>Real-World (Meta) Creation:</strong>
            <p class="mb-0 small text-muted">
                This "live" sound was created by Michael Ragsdale (as Director) and Gemini (as Co-Producer) using Suno AI. We used the "Cover" function to re-record studio tracks with specific "live" style prompts. Post-production was done in <strong>GarageBand</strong> to enhance audience sounds and layer in crowd effects, creating the final stadium atmosphere.
