                The 1987 Debut Album
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                The debut album from The Stardust Engine. While a commercial success, its creation was defined by the "cold war" between the band and their label, Apex Records.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                The album is a sonic battlefield. Apex Records wanted a polished "Stardust" synth-pop record to compete on the charts. The band wanted to unleash their "Engine" rock energy. The result is a fascinating mix of studio-mandated pop and the band's own "malicious compliance" tracks.

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The solid <strong>#2 hit</strong>. It sat at the runner-up spot for six weeks, famously blocked from #1 by a certain "novelty song" that swept the summer of '87.

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                Ryan's first act of "malicious compliance." He hid angsty, anti-corporate lyrics about "living under a plastic sky" inside a polished, studio-approved pop-rock wrapper.

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                A power ballad the studio marketed as a romance, but which the band wrote about their family bond. This "sibling-love-disguised-as-romance" became a staple of their early sound.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                A studio-mandated "safe" synth-pop track. High energy and polished, but devoid of the "Engine" grit Ryan wanted to include.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                Another protest song. Ryan sings about being a "shadow in the light" and having his guitar suppressed ("This keyboard hook is all a bore / I know this guitar's made for more").
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                Cassidy's moody, introspective track. Apex saw it as "filler," but its honest lyrics about her treatment in the industry ("They tell me 'wear the red dress'") made it a surprise grassroots hit with female fans.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The song Apex Records poured <em>all</em> of their money into. They were convinced this polished synth-pop track would be "The Big One." It wasn't.

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                The one "pure rock" anthem Apex allowed on the album. It opened Side B and became an immediate fan-favorite for its raw energy.

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                An epic male and female duet. It features soaring vocals and a massive chorus, but the production was polished to a shine by the studio to remove any "rough edges."
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                "Safe" filler. A polished synth-pop track designed to pad the runtime without causing waves.

        </div>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                Ryan's punk-inspired vent. Apex "gleefully" cut this 1:35 track from the original vinyl release to save space, further fueling Ryan's rage.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 small">
                Atmospheric synth-pop. A moody closer for the standard tracks, showcasing Cassidy's "Stardust" persona.

            </div>
            <p class="mb-1 fs-5 text-body">
                Buried at the end of the album, this is the band's true anthem.
            </p>
            <p class="small text-muted">
                Now that the band is free of Apex Records, this is the fan favorite at every concert (unless you are an "Ironhead"). Critics and chart historians agree: had this been released as a single, it would have spent <strong>11 straight weeks at #1</strong>, dethroning the existing record holder for the longest-running #1 hit of the decade.
