            <p class="lead text-secondary">
                This wasn't a mail-order cassette; it was a gamble. The band's first retail release on their own label, <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>.

            <p class="text-muted">
                While <em>The Warehouse Tapes</em> (1995) was a raw "bat signal" to the fans, <em>Hard Reset</em> was a professional statement. It sounds crisp, confident, and terrified. The "energy" of this album is fueled by the high-stakes gamble of a family betting their entire future on a single purchase order.

                    "We're wiping the slate clean." The opening statement of their professional career. It establishes the new "Freedom Era" sound: polished, powerful 80s rock that ignores the 90s grunge trend entirely.

                    An upbeat duet that directly addresses their past. Ryan sings, "You were the 'Stardust,' I was the 'Engine' / A story told by someone else's invention." It is a declaration that they are finally defining themselves.

                    A rewriting of their 1987 hit "My Anchor Holds." In the original, they were clinging to each other for survival. In this version, they are equals: "I'm not the anchor, you're not the sail / We're just a ship that will prevail."

                <p class="mb-0 small text-muted">
                    For <em>The Warehouse Tapes</em>, the band burned CDs one at a time. For <em>Hard Reset</em>, Holly O'Connell (CEO) had to sign a contract for <strong>50,000 stamped CDs</strong> and 20,000 cassettes, paid for upfront with the fans' money. If this album failed, the band wouldn't just be dropped; they would be bankrupt. The tension of that "First-Time Jitter" is audible in the tightness of the rhythm section.
