                        Holly stood by the heavy oak door, holding it open. She didn't look back at the screen or the bankrupt executives. She watched her family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the floor, Cassidy was rocking violently, her hands clamped over her ears. She was gone. This wasn't just a bad day; it was the **worst neurological collapse of her entire life.** The "mask" hadn't just cracked; it had disintegrated the moment Jameson Frost threatened to "rip apart" her baby—the 15-minute autobiography <em>Escape Velocity (Ad Astra)</em>.

                    <p>
                        Ryan rolled his wheelchair backward a few inches. "Evan. Tyler," he said softly. "Code Carry."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Secure Protocol:</strong> Holly knelt briefly, gently removing Cassidy's glasses. "I've got them, Cass," she whispered, slipping the frames into her hard-shell briefcase.

                        They lifted her effortlessly. Cassidy didn't fight them, but the sensory pain was still ripping through her. She was sobbing uncontrollably, unable to find a safe place to hide her face even as they moved her into the hallway.

                    <p>

                        They turned right, walking straight down the plush carpet of the main executive corridor. The open-plan "Bullpen" was silent. Dozens of analysts, assistants, and junior VPs stood at their cubicles, staring in horror at the sobbing woman being carried by her family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly didn't shield Cassidy. She didn't ask them to look away. She walked with her head high, forcing every employee at Omni-Global to witness the human cost of their business model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        David, the Junior Associate, walked beside Holly, looking shaken by the raw sound of Cassidy's distress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Sorry you had to see that," David said, gesturing toward the shouting coming from the Chairman's office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Don't be," Holly replied. "It's the sweetest sound I've heard all morning. It means she's still fighting."

                    <p>
                        They reached the reception desk. <strong>Jessica</strong>, the young intern, was trembling in her manual chair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Jessica," Holly said, stopping the formation. "Grab your bag. You're coming with us."

                        Evan and Tyler gently lowered Cassidy to the floor, keeping the cushion under her knees. She curled up immediately, rocking against the metal wall. David stood by the control panel, watching the numbers blur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "My son... his name is Toby," David said suddenly. "He's six. He loves rockets... but loud noises wreck him. When I saw your sister..."

                    <p>
                        He looked at Cassidy on the floor, surrounded by her family.

                    <p>
                        "I didn't know you could fight back," David whispered. "In this building... we're taught to ignore it."

                    <p>
                        Ryan looked up. "You don't ignore it, David. You lock the wheels. You hold the line."

                    <p>
                        Holly handed David a note. "Anaheim Colosseum. Next month. Four passes. Bring Toby. Bring Jessica."
