                    <p>
                        The room was vibrating with tension. Cassidy was on the floor, shielded by Ryan's wheelchair. Evan and Tyler stood like bouncers, blocking the executives from the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jameson Frost, however, was pacing. He looked at the huddled family with undisguised disgust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "This... this is unbelievable," Jameson sputtered, looking at Holly. "We are talking about a nine-figure deal, and she’s having a tantrum over a remix? This is exactly why you need professional management. You are emotionally unstable."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly O'Connell hadn't moved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She sat at the head of the mahogany table, her pen resting on her notebook. She looked at the slide on the screen—the mutilated waveform of <em>Ad Astra</em>. Then she looked at the Balance Sheet in her head.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She knew she could buy Omni-Global right now. She could write a check, pay off their debt, fire Jameson, and burn this building down for the insurance money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that was too easy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Jameson," Holly said. The voice cut through the chaos like a razor blade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jameson turned to her. "What?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Sit down," Holly commanded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Excuse me? I am the Vice President of—"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>"I said sit down."</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't a request. It was the tone of a woman who owned the room. Frost, bewildered by the sudden shift in gravity, sank into his chair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly reached out and pulled the wireless keyboard toward her. She didn't look at it. She looked directly at Frost as she hit <code>ALT + TAB</code>.
                    </p>

                        The "Synergy Proposal" vanished from the 85-inch screen. A web browser appeared. Holly typed rapidly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You think we're a charity case," Holly said, her voice calm and even. "You see a wheelchair and a meltdown and you think 'desperate.' So you offered us an 'All-Cash' deal."
                    </p>

                        "But I did my homework, Jameson. And I speak fluent 'Finance.'"

                        Holly scrolled to the Balance Sheet. She pointed the mouse cursor at the lines, narrating in plain English for the entire room to hear.

                    <p>
                        "You aren't a savior, Jameson. You're a squatter. You're trying to use our credit score to refinance your bad decisions."

                    <p>
                        She closed her notebook. She didn't look back at the screen. She stood up, finally, not to intimidate, but to leave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Ryan, get Cassidy. We're done here."

                    <p>
                        She walked to the door, pausing only once to look back at the pale, sweating Vice President.

                    <p>
                        "And Jameson? Update your resume. I hear Sears is hiring. Though, looking at their Q3 bond yields... maybe not for long."
