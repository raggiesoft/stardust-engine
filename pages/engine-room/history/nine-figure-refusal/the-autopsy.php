                    <p>
                        The room was vibrating with tension. Cassidy was on the floor, shielded by Ryan's wheelchair. Evan and Tyler stood like bouncers, blocking the executives from the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jameson Frost, however, was pacing. He looked at the huddled family with undisguised disgust.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "This... this is unbelievable," Jameson sputtered, looking at Holly. "We are talking about a nine-figure deal, and she’s having a tantrum over a remix? This is exactly why you need professional management. You are emotionally unstable."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly O'Connell hadn't moved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She sat at the head of the mahogany table, her pen resting on her notebook. She thought about why she was here. She wasn't here for the money. She was on vacation. She was supposed to be at the Santa Monica Pier.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She had taken this meeting for one reason: <strong>Disrespect.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Jameson," Holly said. The voice cut through the chaos like a razor blade.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jameson turned to her. "What?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Sit down," Holly commanded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Excuse me? I am the Vice President of—"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>"I said sit down."</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It wasn't a request. It was the tone of a CEO addressing a subordinate. Frost, bewildered by the sudden shift in gravity, sank into his chair.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Do you know why we're here, Jameson?" Holly asked, opening her laptop.
                    </p>
                    
                    <div class="credential-box p-3 my-4 shadow-sm">
                        <p class="mb-0 text-muted fst-italic">
                            Holly didn't ask for a cable. She typed a quick sequence, authenticating to the building's Tier 1 secure network: <strong>Pacific Rim Properties</strong>. 
                            <br><br>
                            She hit <code>CTRL+K</code> to open the <strong>Quantum Cast</strong> menu. The massive 85-inch monitor on the wall—hardware leased from Pacific Rim—recognized the command immediately. Following its hard-coded protocols, the device prioritized the Landlord signal over the Tenant signal, dumping Frost's connection and instantly mirroring her screen.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        "What the hell?" Frost stood up, looking at the screen, then at the IT director in the corner. "Who authorized that? She's not on the network!"
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The IT Director was frantically tapping his tablet, his face pale. "Sir... she's not on <em>our</em> network. The monitor is responding to an override from the Infrastructure Layer. I can't stop it. It's pre-empting our traffic."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "How did you do that?" Frost demanded, staring at Holly. "We have enterprise-grade encryption. You can't just Quantum Cast into my boardroom!"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Holly didn't answer. She didn't even look up from her keyboard. She simply let the question hang in the air, a terrifying variable that Frost couldn't solve.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "It's not your offer," she said, watching the wireless handshake complete. "I deleted your offer."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A new window appeared on the giant screen. It wasn't a spreadsheet. It was an email client.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We're here because last Tuesday, you bypassed my office. You sent an email directly to <code>tyler.wright@</code>."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost paled. "I... I was simply reaching out to key stakeholders."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Tyler's email isn't public," Holly continued, her voice dangerously calm. "There is no 'admin@' catch-all. Evan has our <strong>Quantum Enterprise</strong> tenancy completely locked down. You can't search for us on <strong>Quantum Nexus</strong>. The server doesn't even confirm if a user exists."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She pointed at the screen, highlighting the email header.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That means you looked at my email—<code>holly.oconnell@</code>—and you guessed the pattern. You sat there typing names from our Band Bio page—<code>tyler.wright@</code>—until one didn't bounce back."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She looked him dead in the eye.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You assumed that because I'm a woman, I couldn't possibly be the decision maker. You assumed you had to hack your way through to 'the men' to get the real deal done."
                    </p>

                        <p>Tyler,</p>
                        <p>I tried reaching out to your "Manager" (Holly?), but I haven't heard back. I assume she's overwhelmed with the day-to-day admin work. These deals can be complex.</p>
                        <p>Look, I tried to message your band on The Sprawl (@StardustEngine), but whoever runs that account just kept sending me pictures of space? Very confusing branding. You should really tell your social media girl to check her DMs.</p>
                        <p>Anyway, we're ready to make a serious offer. We're talking generational wealth here. I think it's time we get the key players in a room and hash this out—you, me, and Ryan. We can handle the numbers, <strong>let the girls handle the merch.</strong></p>
                        <p>Let me know when you're in LA.</p>

                    <p>
                        The silence in the room was absolute. Even the junior analysts looked horrified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "That account on The Sprawl?" Holly asked, her voice dry. "It belongs to an astronomy student in New Zealand. He posts photos of nebulas. I didn't sue him for trademark infringement because I happen to like the pictures. The fact that you couldn't tell the difference between a global media brand and a hobbyist telescope feed is... concerning."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She stood up and walked to the head of the table, pointing to the line in the email about "the girls."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "And this," Holly said, tapping the screen. "Let the girls handle the merch."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She smiled. It wasn't a nice smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You're right, Jameson. 'The girls' <em>do</em> handle the merch. Cassidy designs it. I fulfill it."

                        She tapped a key. The email vanished. Her professional CV appeared on the screen. She looked around the table at the room full of <strong>Gilded League</strong> MBAs and realized something that made her blood run cold: <strong>She was the only qualified person in the room.</strong>

                        Holly started to close her laptop, then stopped. She turned to look at the glass wall of the conference room, overlooking Century City.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "One last thing, Jameson. Nice office. <strong>Pacific Rim Properties</strong> manages this building, correct?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost blinked, confused by the sudden change in topic. "Yes. They are the landlord. We have a standard lease."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Do you know who owns Pacific Rim Properties?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Some holding company. What does that matter?"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly pulled a piece of paper from her folder and slid it across the mahogany table. It wasn't a legal brief. It was a Tenant Ledger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Pacific Rim is a wholly owned subsidiary of the <strong>O'Connell Family Trust</strong>. I am Pacific Rim."

                        "You asked earlier how I connected to your screen? I didn't hack it. I authenticated as the Owner."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She watched the realization dawn on him. It was slow, painful, and absolutely total.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You never made the connection, did you?" she said, her voice dropping to a conversational tone. "You saw 'Holly O'Connell' on the band roster and thought 'manager.' You saw 'H. O'Connell' on your rent invoices and thought 'landlord.' It never occurred to you that we might be the same person because your worldview doesn't allow for a band manager to own a skyscraper."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She gestured around the room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I've never been to this building before today, Jameson. I manage Pacific Rim remotely from Virginia. I let Elena run the day-to-day. But make no mistake: I own the chair you're sitting in. And according to my records, your July and August rent checks bounced."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She leaned forward, her eyes narrowing.

                    <p>
                        Silence hung in the air for exactly three seconds. Then, Jameson Frost started to laugh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was a dry, condescending chuckle. He looked at his Junior Counsel, a young man in a tailored suit named Bradford.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "She's bluffing," Frost said, shaking his head. "Bradford, tell her."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bradford cleared his throat, looking nervous but eager to please. "Actually, Ms. O'Connell... under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161, a verbal Notice to Quit is not legally binding. It must be served in writing, stating the precise amount due, and providing a three-day cure period."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Frost smirked, leaning back in his chair. "See? You can't just declare eviction by saying the word. You're not a magician. You need paperwork, honey."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly looked at Bradford. "You're right. Section 1161(2). In writing. Three days to pay or quit."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She reached down to her <strong>pristine leather briefcase</strong>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Funny you should mention that."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Click. Click.</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She opened the case. From the front pocket, she pulled a single, crisp sheet of heavy cream-colored linen stock paper. The logo at the top—a stylized column—was embossed in silver foil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She didn't hand it to Bradford. She slid it across the mahogany table directly to Jameson Frost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was pure reflex. Jameson reached out and snatched the document before it slid off the edge. He held it up, blinking at the embossed silver logo, his brain struggling to process the heavy, expensive texture of the linen stock. <em>What is this?</em>

                        "I stopped by the Pacific Rim office on Monday when we landed," Holly said softly. "Printed on 32lb linen stock. Served to a corporate officer. Witnesses present."

                    <p>
                        Frost looked down at the paper. The laughter died in his throat.

                        "You have seventy-two hours, Jameson," she said, finally snapping her briefcase shut. "Clock started when you touched that paper."

                    <p>
                        Holly reached over and snapped her laptop shut, severing the connection to the giant screen. The room plunged back into silence.

                        "You aren't a savior, Jameson. You're a squatter. You're trying to use our credit score to refinance your bad decisions. And you were arrogant enough to insult the most qualified person in this room."
