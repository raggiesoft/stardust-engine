                        <strong>Timeline Note:</strong> This interview takes place 5 months after the "Triple Tap" filings. The SEC has frozen Omni-Global's assets, but the Department of Justice has not yet unsealed the criminal indictments against individual executives. Jameson Frost believes he is still a free man. Jessica Miller knows better.
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Jameson Frost walked into the main lobby of 2000 Avenue of the Stars. He adjusted his silk tie, ready to ascend to his former kingdom. He marched toward the elevator bank, looking for the "Up" button.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        He stopped. There were no buttons.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Instead, a cluster of sleek glass kiosks stood in the center of the hallway. People were tapping screens and being directed to different cars. Frost stared at them, confused. <em>Destination Dispatch.</em> He had heard of it—a "efficiency upgrade" the building management had installed last month—but he had never used it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He stepped up to a kiosk and jabbed his finger at the screen where it said <strong>FLOOR SELECTION</strong>. He typed <strong>40</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP.</em> The screen flashed red. <strong class="text-danger">ACCESS RESTRICTED.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Ridiculous," Frost muttered. He tried again. <strong>40.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>BEEP.</em> <strong class="text-danger">SEE SECURITY.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Is there a problem, sir?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost spun around. A uniformed security guard was standing behind him, holding a tablet. Not a rent-a-cop, but one of the new building security team members. Professional. armed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Yes, there is a problem," Frost snapped. "This machine is broken. I have a meeting with the Executive Director. I need to get to the Penthouse."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The guard looked at his tablet. "Name?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Jameson Frost. Vice President of—" He caught himself. "Former Vice President."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The guard tapped the screen. "Ah. Yes. Mr. Frost. You are cleared."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The guard reached over Frost's shoulder and typed a code into the kiosk. The screen didn't say 40.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong class="text-primary display-6">FLOOR 38 &bull; CAR D</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "38?" Frost scoffed. "That's the lower level. I'm meeting the Director."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "That is the Director's floor, sir," the guard said, pointing to the far bank of elevators. "Car D. It is arriving now. Please step inside."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost grumbled and walked over to Car D. The doors slid open. He stepped in... and realized his mistake.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There were no buttons inside the car. No panel. No way to override the destination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He was trapped in a sleek metal box that had already decided his fate. He stood there, helpless, as the car shot upward, bypassing the Penthouse entirely and depositing him on the 38th floor.
                    </p>

                    <hr class="my-5 border-secondary opacity-25">

                    <p>
                        The doors opened. Frost stepped out, expecting the high-gloss marble he had installed two years ago. Instead, his Italian loafers sank slightly into a matte, sound-dampening cork floor. The aggressive blue lighting was gone, replaced by a warm, golden glow.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Mr. Frost?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost turned. A young man was standing there, holding a tablet in a rugged case. He was wearing faded jeans and a black t-shirt featuring a neon blue rocket. He was heavy-set, his breathing audible, but he stood with the solidity of a bouncer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost forced a smile. "I'm here to see the Executive Director, son. Is she upstairs?" He pointed a thumb toward the ceiling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Justin Miller</strong> didn't smile back. He simply pointed to a glass-walled office right there in the lobby.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "She. Is. There."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost blinked. "Down here? In the... fishbowl?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Justin tapped an icon on his screen. <strong class="text-primary">"Follow. Me."</strong>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Frost followed him into the office. It was modest. Functional. But the view of the Hollywood Hills was just as majestic as he remembered.

                            The Cultural Fit Assessment.

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Sitting behind the desk was a girl. A heavy-set girl with curly hair and thick glasses. She was wearing blue jeans and a black t-shirt with the logo <strong class="text-uppercase">The Stardust Engine</strong> emblazoned on the front. On her feet were comfortable, worn sneakers—not the pinched heels he used to mandate for female staff.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She was holding a half-eaten taco. She didn't put it down when he entered.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Excuse me," Frost said, his tone dripping with impatience. "I'm looking for Ms. Miller. The Director."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The girl took a slow bite of her lunch. She chewed, swallowed, and wiped her hands on a napkin. Then she looked up.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "You're looking at her, Jameson."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost froze. He squinted. The face was familiar... but the context was wrong. This wasn't an executive. This was...
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "The intern?" Frost blurted out. "The one with the... the wheels?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Jessica</strong> (Age 20) smiled. It wasn't a warm smile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "The one you forced to wear heels even though I can't walk," she corrected him. "The one you called 'pathetic' in the Bus Memo because I used my wheelchair as a walker."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She pressed a button on the desk. With a quiet hum, the surface rose slightly, adjusting perfectly to her posture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Sit down, Jameson."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost sat. The visitor chair was lower than he remembered. He felt small. He looked up at the ceiling, thinking of his old office two floors above.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "I assume you're renovating the 40th floor?" Frost asked, trying to regain control. "That explains why I couldn't get up there. My old office... it had great bones. I assume you kept the marble?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jessica chuckled softly. "Actually, we gutted it. The marble caused too much acoustic reverb."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Gutted it?" Frost looked horrified. "What did you put in its place?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Moss," Jessica said simply. "Ferns. Living walls. Your old office is now <strong>Zone C of the Quiet Floor</strong>. It's a biophilic atrium where people go to decompress from stress. It's very popular."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost stared at her. "You filled my office... with moss?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "It smells much better now," Justin added from the doorway, his synthesized voice devoid of sarcasm yet stinging all the same.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost cleared his throat, his face flushing. "Right. Well. Let's be honest, Jessica. You're swimming in deep waters now. You're managing a $2 billion endowment. You need someone who knows where the bodies are buried."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "We know where the bodies are buried, Jameson," Jessica said calmly. "We have the audit. Holly filed it."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost waved a hand dismissively. "Accounting errors. Technicalities. The SEC will slap us with a fine and we'll move on. That's how the game is played. And that's why you need me. I can make those problems... disappear."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He leaned forward, dropping his voice to a conspiratorial whisper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "I can protect you. The market is going to come for you. The sharks are circling. You need a killer at the gate."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Jessica glanced at Justin. "Mr. Frost," she said softly. "We aren't worried about the market sharks."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She tapped a blue folder on her desk.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "We're worried about your... schedule."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "My schedule is wide open," Frost said quickly. "I can start Monday."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "Monday might work," Jessica agreed. "But what about six months from now? When the USPIS finishes their review of the 'OGM Capital' mailers?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Frost froze. The color drained from his face. "The... who?"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "The Postal Inspectors," Jessica clarified. "Holly filed Form 8165 in September. Mail Fraud isn't a 'technicality,' Jameson. It's a felony. And unlike the SEC, they don't issue fines."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Justin stepped forward. He turned his tablet screen toward Frost. It wasn't a job offer. It was a calendar.
                    </p>

                        </span>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The silence in the room was absolute.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "You... you can't know that," Frost whispered. "No indictments have been unsealed."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        "We have a very good lawyer," Jessica replied, picking up her taco again. "She says the sentencing guidelines for $400 million in fraud start at fifteen years. Minimum."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She pointed to the door with her free hand.

                        "The interview is over, Jameson. Go home. Spend time with your family. While you still can."

                        Jameson Frost stood up. His legs felt weak. He looked at the girl he had bullied—comfortable in her jeans, her band t-shirt, and her power. She wasn't scared anymore. She was the one holding the gavel.

                        He walked out of the office, past the Justin Miller Center logo, and back to the elevator. He stepped into a waiting car, the doors closing before he could even look for a button to press. He was just cargo now.
