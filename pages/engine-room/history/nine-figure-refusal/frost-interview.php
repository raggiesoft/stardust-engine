                Jameson Frost walked in wearing a $5,000 suit to impress the owners. He didn't realize the owners were the kids in the t-shirts he just ignored.

                <p>
                    Jameson Frost adjusted his silk tie. He checked his reflection in the glass. Perfect. He looked like money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Mr. Frost?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frost turned. A young man was standing there. He was wearing faded jeans and a black t-shirt featuring a neon blue rocket inside a gear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frost sighed internally. <em>IT support,</em> he thought. <em>Probably here to fix the wi-fi.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I'm here to see the Director, son," Frost said dismissively. "Is she in?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Justin Miller didn't speak. He just gestured toward the double doors with his mPad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Right. Thanks," Frost muttered, brushing past him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Frost walked into the massive corner office. He expected a mahogany desk. He expected a CEO in a power suit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead, he saw a woman sitting in a wheelchair behind a simple, modern desk.

                        "The Distance: Frost instinctively sat in the visitor chair furthest from the desk, creating a physical gap that matched the sudden realization of who held the power."
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    She was wearing jeans and the exact same black t-shirt as the boy in the hallway: <strong>THE STARDUST ENGINE</strong> logo glowing on her chest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She was eating a brisket taco.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frost paused. He sat in the chair, but he didn't scoot it closer. He stayed five feet back, frozen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ah, casual Friday?" Frost joked, his voice echoing in the gap between them. "I love the... team spirit. But is the Executive Director around? I have a 2:00 PM."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The woman wiped her hands on a napkin. She adjusted her glasses.
                </p>
                <div class="border-start border-4 border-success ps-4 py-3 bg-dark text-light shadow-sm mb-3 rounded-end">

                        <strong>Jessica:</strong> "You're looking at her, Jameson."

                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Frost blinked. He squinted. The t-shirt threw him off. The taco threw him off. But the voice...
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I... I'm sorry," Frost stammered. "I assumed... with the branding..."
                </p>
                
                <div class="border-start border-4 border-success ps-4 py-3 bg-dark text-light shadow-sm mb-3 rounded-end">

                    <p class="mb-0 small text-white-50">
                        Justin walked in and stood next to her. He crossed his arms. The two of them—twins in matching band shirts—stared at the man in the suit.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Frost’s brain finally made the connection. The wheelchair. The round face. The "intern" he had terrorized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Jessica?" he whispered. "The... the girl with the coffee?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The girl you told to eat a salad," Jessica corrected, picking up her taco. "We prefer brisket now. Better for the metabolism. Remember? Hashimoto's?"
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mb-5">
                <h5 class="text-info text-uppercase fw-bold letter-spacing-1 mb-3 border-bottom border-info pb-2">The Rejection</h5>
                <p>
                    Frost looked at his suit. Then he looked at their t-shirts. He looked at the distance between his chair and her desk. He suddenly felt very overdressed and very unsafe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I... I see you've done well for yourself," Frost tried to pivot. "It's a nice... setup. But surely you need someone with corporate experience to handle the—"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Justin tapped his mPad.
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>
                    Jessica leaned forward. The neon rocket on her shirt seemed to glow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "You judge people by their packaging, Jameson," Jessica said. "You saw a t-shirt and assumed 'staff.' You saw a wheelchair and assumed 'liability.' You saw a body type and assumed 'lazy.'"
                </p>
                <p>
                    She opened his file and dropped it into the recycling bin. She didn't even look at it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We don't have a dress code here," Jessica said. "But we do have a 'No Assholes' policy."
                </p>
                <p>
                    She pointed to the door with a taco-filled hand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Interview over. Don't let the door hit you on the way out. It's freshly painted."
