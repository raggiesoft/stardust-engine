                    <p class="text-muted">
                        In 1992, Apex Records assigned a new Executive Producer, <strong>Julian Vance</strong>, to the band. Julian looked at the roster, saw "Ryan O'Connell" and "Cassidy O'Connell," and made the lazy, catastrophic assumption that they were a married couple.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        He based this entire theory on a single 1989 promo photo where the two were physically close. He interpreted their lack of personal space as sexual chemistry. He was wrong. It was <em>medical necessity</em> and <em>neurological safety</em>.
                    </p>

                                Ryan's T10 paralysis requires complex, 24/7 care managed by his sisters. But beyond the medicine, both Ryan and Cassidy are <strong>autistic</strong>. They are each other's "Safe Person."

                                They rely on close physical contact—hugs, leaning, cuddling—for sensory regulation and grounding. Julian Vance looked at a family unit built on survival, safety, and non-sexual intimacy, and projected his own perversion onto it.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Julian pitched the title <strong>"Friction."</strong> The band, obsessed with their astronomy theme, was ecstatic. They immediately interpreted it as the scientific friction of a space shuttle re-entering Earth's atmosphere. They recorded a demo for "Atmosphere," singing about "burning up." Julian heard it and assumed they were playing along with his metaphor.

                                At the photo shoot, Julian revealed his true vision. He rejected the space theme. He presented a lyrical draft that demanded Ryan and Cassidy sing about—and sound like they were engaging in—actual sexual intercourse.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Ryan O'Connell famously threw the lyrical draft into the trash. The band wasn't disgusted by the nudity or the concept of sex—as caregivers, they dealt with naked bodies and biological functions every day. They were disgusted by the <strong>violation</strong> of their safety.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Julian sneered, still thinking it was a gimmick. Then he looked at the "plain manager" in the corner: <strong>Holly O'Connell</strong>.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Holly was 23 years old. She was a <strong>2nd-Year Law Student (2L) at CPI</strong>. She hadn't passed the Bar yet, but she knew exactly what "Solicitation of a Felony" looked like. She stepped out of the shadows, not as a sister, but as <strong>The Manager</strong>—weaponizing every word of the law she was studying.
