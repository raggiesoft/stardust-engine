                    </h2>
                    <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                        In 1991, The Stardust Engine was in a stalemate with their label, Apex Records. 
                        For their third album, a new, "rogue agent" executive, Julian Vance, was assigned to the project.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Julian wanted to create a "sex-sells" competitor to <strong>Cydele's</strong> <em>Sanctuary</em>. He formulated his entire plan looking at this specific <strong>1989 publicity photo</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        He saw the physical affection—Ryan's arm around her, Cassidy leaning in—and made a lazy, catastrophic assumption: <strong>"They're a couple."</strong>

                2. The "Friction" Misunderstanding
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                Julian pitched the title <strong>"Friction."</strong> The band, obsessed with their astronomy theme, was ecstatic. They believed the label was finally embracing their identity and planned an album about the literal, scientific <strong>friction of a space shuttle re-entering the atmosphere.</strong>

                Ryan arrived in his wheelchair — the permanent result of the 1990 crash. Julian, confused but arrogant, waved it off and insisted they could "shoot around it," failing to see that several of his explicit shot‑list items were now physically impossible.

Ryan, a straight-edge "Ironhead" whose only reference for drugs was the animated smoke in <em>Toon Brigade</em>, genuinely thought it was drywall dust. He <strong>wiped the mirror clean</strong> with a napkin, humiliating Julian and destroying $500 worth of product.

                        <strong>MITCHELL:</strong> Yes. Ryan rolled in early. We actually had a gentle conversation about lighting the wheelchair. He was very specific—he didn't want us to hide it. He told me, "I want the kids to see it. I want them to know you can be paralyzed and still be a rock star."

                        <strong>MITCHELL:</strong> Then Julian arrived. He grabbed my shot list, crossed out the word "SIMULATED" with a thick marker, and shoved it at Ryan. The note wasn't artistic direction. It was a demand for the siblings to <span class="bg-secondary text-dark px-1">[REDACTED]</span> on camera.

                    <strong>Friction</strong> was permanently canceled. The band was free. Holly O'Connell founded <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>, and the band, fueled by the trauma, retreated to their Blacksburg warehouse to record their true debut: 1995's <strong>The Warehouse Tapes.</strong>
