                        There was no red ribbon. There was no champagne. Just a massive, gleaming silver monolith sitting under the fluorescent lights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "Iron Horse" (Unit 02) wasn't painted yet. It was raw stainless steel and aluminum. It looked like a spacecraft.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Michel stood by the open door. He looked tired but proud. The floor crew—the welders, the electricians, the upholsterers—had gathered around. They didn't usually come out for deliveries. But they wanted to see this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We tested it with 1,000 pounds of lead weights," Michel said in French to Holly. "But we haven't tested it with a person yet."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holly turned to Ryan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan sat in his everyday wheelchair (a beat-up titanium rig from 1998). He looked at the bus. For ten years, touring had meant being carried up stairs by bouncers. It meant crawling into bunks. It meant indignity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Ready?" Ryan asked.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Michel pressed a button on the hidden exterior panel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>HISS. CLICK. WHIRRR.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A seamless section of the bus's side panel detached and lowered smoothly to the ground. It wasn't a clunky bolt-on lift. It was <em>integrated</em> into the chassis. It sat flush with the concrete floor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan rolled onto the platform. He locked his brakes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Michel pressed 'UP'.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The hydraulic system—reinforced with the extra steel Holly had insisted on—lifted him silently. No shaking. No straining. It rose to the floor height of the cabin in six seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan rolled off the lift and into the bus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The aisle was 4 inches wider than standard. He could spin 360 degrees. He rolled to the back. The bathroom door slid open automatically. The bunk room had a transfer bar installed exactly where he asked for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He rolled back to the front of the bus, looking down at the assembly crew standing on the concrete below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ryan O'Connell didn't smile. He nodded. A deep, respectful nod to the men in the welding masks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="text-success fst-italic">"C'est solide,"</span> Ryan said. (It's solid.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The crew erupted in applause.
                    </p>
