                        <strong>CONTEXT:</strong> The Music Industry is at its peak (CD era). Every label is ordering fleets. The waitlist for a custom H3-45 is 24 months.

                <p>
                    The walls of the Sainte-Claire facility were shaking. Not from the machinery, but from the man in the $5,000 suit screaming into a Nokia brick phone.

                    <p class="mb-2"><strong>The Exec:</strong> "I don't care about 'fabrication lead times'! We have a Platinum record! I want gold faucets! I want a jacuzzi in the back! And I want it by July! Do you people even understand urgency?"</p>

                        (He threw a brochure at the translator.)

                <p>
                    Michel, the young Floor Manager, rubbed his temples. He hated the music industry. They treated his engineers like servants and his buses like toys.
                </p>

            <div class="mb-5">

                <p>
                    Michel sighed and walked into the next office. He prepared his "Non" speech. The order book was full until 2004.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He opened the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sitting at the table were five people in plain clothes. They weren't yelling. They were studying a chassis schematic spread out on the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The woman in the center (Holly, Age 33) looked up. She didn't ask for coffee. She didn't ask for a translator.
                </p>
                
                <div class="border-start border-4 border-success ps-4 py-3 bg-dark shadow-sm mb-3">
                    <p class="mb-3">
                        <strong>Holly:</strong> <span class="text-success fst-italic">"Bonjour, Monsieur Dubois. Nous étudions la résistance à la torsion de votre châssis H3-45. C'est une ingénierie remarquable."</span>
                        <br><small class="text-muted">(Good day, Mr. Dubois. We are studying the torsional rigidity of your H3-45 chassis. It is remarkable engineering.)</small>

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Michel froze. Her accent was perfect. Not Parisian. <em>Québécois.</em> She used the local inflection for 'châssis.'
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    "You speak... our French?" Michel asked, stunned.

                        <strong>Ryan (Age 35):</strong> <span class="text-success fst-italic">"Si on veut construire la meilleure machine, il faut parler la langue des constructeurs. On ne veut pas d'erreurs de traduction sur les soudures."</span>
                        <br><small class="text-muted">(If we want to build the best machine, we must speak the language of the builders. We do not want translation errors on the welds.)</small>

                <h5 class="text-info text-uppercase fw-bold letter-spacing-1 mb-3">The Blueprint</h5>
                <p>
                    Holly slid a document across the table. It wasn't a list of luxuries. There were no gold faucets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We need a custom build," Holly said in French. "We need you to cut the chassis here, here, and here."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michel looked at the specs. "You want to widen the aisle by 4 inches? And reinforce the sub-floor for... a 800lb hydraulic lift?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    "My brother is a T10 Paraplegic," Holly explained, gesturing to Ryan. <span class="text-success fst-italic">"Ce bus n'est pas un jouet. C'est ses jambes. Si le lift brise en tournée, le spectacle est fini."</span>
                    <br><small class="text-muted">(This bus is not a toy. It is his legs. If the lift breaks on tour, the show is over.)</small>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "We don't want a jacuzzi," Ryan added. "We want reliability. We want your best welds. We want a tank."
                </p>
                <p>
                    From Room A, the Exec screamed again: "I WANT THE LEATHER SEATS TO MATCH MY SHOES!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Michel looked at the screaming man. Then he looked at the family who had learned his language just to ensure the welds were safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The waitlist is two years," Michel said, a slow smile spreading across his face. "But... I think the 'Jacuzzi Project' in Bay 4 just ran into a 'scheduling conflict.'"

                        <strong>The Handshake:</strong> Michel canceled the Label Exec's order that afternoon. He put the "Iron Horse" into production immediately.

                        When Holly returned 16 years later to commission <strong>Unit 01 (The Sovereign)</strong>, she didn't have to introduce herself.

                    <p>
                        Michel (now the VP of Operations) walked out onto the floor.
                        <br><em>"L'équipe O'Connell est arrivée!"</em> he shouted to the floor crew.
