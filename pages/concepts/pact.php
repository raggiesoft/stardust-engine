    <div class="fs-5"> <p class="lead mb-4">Anya and Kael Rostova are the two-person reality behind the Axiom's Knox myth. They are fraternal twins, born seven minutes apart (Anya is the elder), and are bound by a deep, platonic sibling love and a shared desire for vengeance against the Axiom for the death of their parents. Their operation relies on the Axiom's inability to see them, a feat achieved by their stark physical differences, which makes them the perfect invisibility cloak.</p>
    <p>The twins' dynamic is later joined by a third member, Pippa (Pip). Pip is 18 years old and the sole survivor of a different native village that was razed by Axiom Sentinels.</p>
