                The "Anchor". Holly (Age 18 in 1987) is the most formidable member of The Stardust Engine, and she has never played a note on stage. A child prodigy, she accelerated her education to start college at 16, allowing her to join her older siblings and cousins at CPI.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                While still a student, she took on the role of the band's manager. Her official role was to act as the emotional peacemaker—famously pulling Ryan and Cassidy into a "three-way hug" when they argued over music, reminding them "You're both right. And you're both idiots."

            <p class="text-muted">
                When Ryan was paralyzed in December 1990, Holly's role expanded from Business Manager to Medical Director. While Cassidy became Ryan's day-to-day "Safe Person," Holly built the infrastructure that kept him alive and working.

                She holds **Durable Power of Attorney** for Ryan, giving her the legal authority to make medical decisions in an emergency. She carries signed, notarized HIPAA release forms in her briefcase at all times, allowing her to speak directly to his doctors and surgeons.

            <h3 class="fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">The "Friction" Nuke</h3>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Holly's true power was revealed during the 1992 "Friction" scandal. By this time, she was a 2L law student. When Julian Vance made his criminal demand, Holly transformed into "Holly the Shark". She secured the evidence that forced Apex Records to surrender the masters, using the freedom to found <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>.

                                In 2012, <strong>Cassidy O'Connell</strong> purchased a single lottery ticket at a gas station in Daleville, VA. She matched all numbers, including the "Dream Ball."

                            <p class="text-light small">
                                The family chose the "Lump Sum" option ($997 Million post-tax). Instead of buying mansions, Cassidy handed the check to Holly and said, <em>"Make us safe."</em>
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-light small mb-0">
                                Holly didn't just bank it. She went back to school. Over the next decade, she acquired a staggering arsenal of financial credentials to ensure that no label, no bank, and no medical crisis could ever threaten her family again.
