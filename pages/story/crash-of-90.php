                They were trying to beat the storm. Fresh off a show in Wytheville, the band was racing the weather reports to get back to Blacksburg before the highways closed.

            <p>
                <strong>Ryan was driving.</strong> He wouldn't let anyone else do it. He knew the trucks on I-81. He knew the "suicide lane" merges. He was doing everything right—40 MPH in the <strong>Holt Freighter</strong>, hazards on, white-knuckling the wheel while the rest of the family slept in the back.
            </p>
            <p>
                It didn't matter. Another driver, impatient and inexperienced with the mountain pass, decided 40 was too slow. The impact was small, but on black ice, physics is unforgiving. The van didn't just slide; it tumbled.

                Ryan sustained a complete T10 spinal cord injury. He retained full use of his hands and "The Engine" (his upper body strength), but lost all function and sensation below the waist. The "Stalemate Year" of 1991 wasn't just a hiatus; it was a boot camp for survival.

                        Spontaneity died on I-81. Ryan requires 60 minutes every morning for a strict <strong>Bowel Program</strong>. Because his body can no longer regulate this automatically, it must be manually triggered (digital stimulation) on a strict schedule to prevent accidents.

                        Ryan manages his bladder via Intermittent Catheterization (IC) every 4 hours. If he waits too long, he risks kidney damage or <strong>Autonomic Dysreflexia</strong> (a life-threatening blood pressure spike).

                    <p class="card-text text-secondary small mb-0">
                        <strong>The Logic:</strong> He constantly calculates water intake vs. showtime. On the 1990s tour buses (which had inaccessible bathrooms), this meant relying on discreet urinals in his bunk, often assisted by Cassidy or Holly when his hands were too tired from playing.

                        <strong>Cassidy's Role:</strong> She is his "Spotter." During interviews or studio sessions, she watches the clock. A subtle tap on his shoulder is their code: <em>"Lift."</em> She also handles the nightly skin checks, looking for red spots that Ryan cannot feel or see.
