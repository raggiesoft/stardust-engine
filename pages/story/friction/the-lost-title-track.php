                    <p class="text-muted">
                        In 1992, Apex Records assigned a new Executive Producer, <strong>Julian Vance</strong>, to the band. Julian had never worked with The Stardust Engine before. He looked at the roster, saw "Ryan O'Connell" and "Cassidy O'Connell," and made the lazy, catastrophic assumption that they were a married couple (like <em>Silver Stream</em>), not blood siblings.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        Julian was obsessed with <strong>Cydele's</strong> upcoming <em>Sanctuary</em> project (the "Sex Book" era). He wanted his own "porn project" to compete. He pitched the title <strong>"Friction"</strong> to the band, envisioning a graphic concept album about sexual tension.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        When Julian pitched the title, the band was ecstatic. They immediately interpreted "Friction" through their own "Cosmos and Rockets" lens: the literal, scientific friction of a space shuttle re-entering Earth's atmosphere.

                            <p class="card-text small text-muted">
                                Believing they were finally on the same page, the band recorded a demo for <strong>"Atmosphere."</strong> The lyrics ("Burning up with our desire," "Breaking through this atmosphere") were about heat shields and ionization. Julian heard the demo and, in his depraved mindset, assumed they were "playing along" with brilliant sexual metaphors.

                            <p>
                                The truth did not come out until the fateful photo shoot in September 1992. It was there that Julian finally revealed his vision for the <strong>Title Track</strong>.

                                He did not want metaphors. He presented a lyrical draft that demanded Ryan and Cassidy sing about—and sound like they were engaging in—actual sexual intercourse. His production notes called for "heavy breathing," "bedspring sounds," and a vocal performance that left nothing to the imagination.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-0 fw-bold text-light">
                                He was demanding that a brother and sister perform incest for a paycheck.

                    <p class="text-muted">
                        The realization of what they had almost agreed to broke the band. Ryan O'Connell famously threw the lyrical draft into the trash, delivering the line that would become legend in the legal depositions that followed:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote border-start border-4 border-danger ps-4 my-4">
                        <p class="fst-italic text-light text-uppercase">"She's! My! Sister!"</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        This specific demand became the "moral ammunition" for Holly O'Connell. While the "Dirty Mirror" incident was humiliating, this lyrical demand was <strong>proof of depravity</strong>. It was the key piece of evidence that convinced Apex Records to void the contract immediately rather than risk the public finding out what they had asked of two siblings.

                                The title track was never recorded. However, the instrumental demo—a heavy, driving rock riff intended to simulate the shaking of a spacecraft—survived in the band's personal archives.

                                In 2015, for their reunion album, the band finally resurrected this riff. They stripped away Julian's perversion and paired the music with their <strong>original</strong> concept. The result was the title track <strong>"Re-Ignition"</strong>—a song about surviving the fire and coming home, exactly as they had always intended.
