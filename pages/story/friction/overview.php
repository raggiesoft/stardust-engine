                                The band had flown in from Virginia the night before. They arrived at the warehouse location early, finding the set cold and the crew still rigging lights. To pass the time, Tyler popped a tape into a rolling TV/VCR cart: a <strong>Rocket Burger</strong> promotional copy of <em>Toon Brigade Against Trouble</em> (1990).

                        In 1991, The Stardust Engine was in a stalemate with their label, Apex Records. 
                        For their third album, a new, "rogue agent" executive, Julian Vance, was assigned to the project.

                        He saw the physical affection—Ryan's arm around her, Cassidy leaning in—and made a lazy, catastrophic assumption: <strong>"They're a couple."</strong>

            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                Julian pitched the title <strong>"Friction."</strong> The band, obsessed with their astronomy theme, was ecstatic. They believed the label was finally embracing their identity and planned an album about the literal, scientific <strong>friction of a space shuttle re-entering the atmosphere.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                They enthusiastically recorded a demo for <strong>"Atmosphere,"</strong> with lyrics about "burning up with our desire" (heat shields). Julian heard the demo and assumed they were playing along with his sexual metaphor.

                Ryan arrived in his wheelchair — the permanent result of the 1990 crash. Julian, confused but arrogant, waved it off and insisted they could "shoot around it," failing to see that several of his explicit shot‑list items were now physically impossible.

He <strong>wiped the mirror clean</strong> with a napkin, humiliating Julian and destroying $500 worth of product.

                Ryan read the line item. It was a demand for a physical act he could not perform, with a woman who was his sister. He roared the words that blew up the project:
