            How a fatal assumption and a catastrophic photo shoot in 1992
            ended the band's "Cold War" and gave them their freedom.

                1. The "Fatal Assumption"
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                In 1991, The Stardust Engine was in a stalemate with their label, Apex Records. 
                For their third album, a new, "rogue agent" executive, Julian Vance, was assigned to the project.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Julian, in a panic over industry leaks of <strong>Cydele's</strong> upcoming <strong>Sanctuary</strong> album and <strong>The Sanctuary Book</strong>, wanted to create his own "sex-sells" competitor. He looked at the band's roster, saw "Ryan O'Connell & Cassidy O'Connell," and made a lazy, fatal assumption: that they were a married couple (like <strong>Silver Stream</strong>), not <strong>blood siblings</strong> (like <strong>The Masons</strong>). He had never even listened to the 1990 <strong>Live in Chicago</strong> album, where Ryan clearly introduces Cassidy as "my sister."

                2. The "Friction" Misunderstanding
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                Julian proposed the working title <strong>"Friction."</strong> The band, obsessed with their astronomy theme ("cosmos and rockets"), was ecstatic. They believed the label was finally embracing their true identity and planned an album about the literal, scientific <strong>friction of a space shuttle re-entering the atmosphere.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                They enthusiastically recorded a demo for <strong>"Atmosphere,"</strong> with lyrics about "burning up with our desire" and "breaking through this atmosphere"—all metaphors for space flight. Julian, in his "depraved" mindset, heard these lyrics as sexual metaphors for his *Sanctuary* knockoff and greenlit the track, convinced the "married couple" was playing along.

                3. The Photo Shoot (September 1992)
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                The entire conflict exploded at the infamous album photo shoot in a cold warehouse. The day was a series of escalating disasters:

                    <strong>The "Dirty Mirror" Incident:</strong> Julian, trying to "loosen up" the band, offered Ryan a tray with champagne and a mirror covered in cocaine. Ryan, who is straight-edge and had never seen the drug, genuinely thought it was dust. He meticulously <strong>wiped the mirror clean</strong> with a napkin, humiliating Julian and destroying $500 worth of cocaine.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-muted border-secondary px-0">
                    <strong>The Clipboard Attack:</strong> Furious and humiliated, Julian snatched the photographer's clipboard. He found the shot list for his "Sex Book" knockoff—<strong>SHOT 12: CASSIDY/RYAN. THE LOVERS. FULL SIMULATED INTERCOURSE.</strong>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item bg-transparent text-muted border-secondary px-0">
                    <strong>The Crime:</strong> In a fit of rage, Julian viciously <strong>scratched out the word "simulated"</strong> and shoved the clipboard at Ryan, demanding they "Do it or be in breach of contract."
                </li>
            </ul>

                4. The Reveal & The Nuke
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                Ryan read the line item. His brain crashed. He roared the words that blew up the project:
            </p>
            
            <blockquote class="blockquote text-center display-6 my-5 text-danger fw-bold text-uppercase" style="font-family: 'Impact', sans-serif; letter-spacing: 2px;">
                "SHE'S! MY! SISTER!"
            </blockquote>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The photographer, Kevin, realized immediately what this meant—a $2 million contract was just detonated to prevent a crime. Julian, however, still didn't understand, assuming they were "stage siblings" like <strong>The Vectors</strong>. It wasn't until Ryan roared that Cassidy was his <strong>blood-related sister</strong> that Julian finally comprehended his catastrophic, felony-level error.

                                Holly O'Connell, then a 2L law student, secured the altered clipboard (Exhibit A) and the <strong>Live in Chicago</strong> tape (Exhibit B). Caught between a criminal case and a civil nuke, Apex Records immediately voided the band's contract and signed over the masters to their first two albums.

                    <strong>Friction</strong> was permanently canceled. The band was free. Holly O'Connell founded <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>, and the band, fueled by the trauma, retreated to their Blacksburg warehouse to record their true debut: 1995's <strong>The Warehouse Tapes.</strong>
