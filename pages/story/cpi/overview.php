                The "Forger" Identity
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                Commonwealth Polytechnic Institute (CPI) is a premier polytechnic university located in Blacksburg, Virginia. Its students and alumni are known as <strong>"Forgers,"</strong> a nod to the school's deep roots in engineering and industrial arts.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                This identity extends to their famously passionate football fanbase, the <strong>"Ironheads."</strong> Known as the "Cameron Crazies of college football," the Ironheads have earned their home stadium, <strong>The Crucible</strong>, a nationwide reputation as the "LOUDEST stadium in all of college football."
            </p>

                The Class of '89: A Family Affair
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                CPI is the literal and spiritual home of The Stardust Engine. All five members are proud alumni who graduated together as the <strong>Class of '89</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                This was only possible because Ryan (the oldest) delayed his entry to age 21, while Holly (the youngest) was a child prodigy who accelerated her education to start at 16. This allowed all five family members—Ryan, Cassidy, Holly, Evan, and Tyler—to begin their CPI journey together in the Fall of 1985, solidifying the bond that would define their future.

                The Sacred Anthem: "Ignition"
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                In 1986, while still students, the band wrote and donated the industrial-rock anthem <strong>"Ignition (The Forger's Call)"</strong> to the university. 
            </p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-dark border-secondary bg-opacity-10 d-flex align-items-center mb-4" role="alert">

                <div class="small text-muted">
                    <strong>The Marching Drill:</strong> The song was designed for the marching band. The bridge features a relentless, shifting cadence that the student section mimics: they sway <strong class="text-primary">Left</strong>, then <strong class="text-primary">Right</strong>, then <strong class="text-primary">Left</strong>, then <strong class="text-primary">Right</strong>, shaking the entire stadium to its foundations.
                </div>
            </div>

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                This song was adopted by the football team as their sacred entrance music, creating an "Enter Sandman-style" tradition where the entire stadium erupts as the team takes the field. This act cemented the band's status as legends on campus, long before they had a record deal.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h3 fw-bold border-bottom border-secondary pb-2 mb-3 mt-5">
                The "Forger Nation War Chest"
            </h2>
            <p class="fs-5 text-muted mb-4">
                This deep, authentic bond with the fanbase is the key to the band's survival. After the 1992 "Friction" scandal, when the band was freed from Apex Records but left with no money, it was the "Forger Nation" that came to their rescue.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                An underground, mail-order fundraiser (the "Forger Nation War Chest") raised enough capital for Holly O'Connell to found <strong>Engine Room Records, LLC</strong>. This fan-funded label allowed the band to record 1995's <strong>The Warehouse Tapes</strong> and build their independent career on their own terms, forever linking their freedom to the loyalty of their fellow CPI alumni.
