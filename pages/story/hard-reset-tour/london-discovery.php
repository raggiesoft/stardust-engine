                        It was sheer chance. Ryan O'Connell and Evan Wright had ducked into the basement club just to escape the London rain.

                        On stage, it wasn't a reunion; it was a ghost story. <strong>Origin</strong> had once been a massive six-piece art-rock orchestra. Now, only two remained: the singer and the flautist. Brother and sister.

                        They had fled to America years ago to escape the "Family Curse"—the alcoholism and addiction that had claimed their parents and the other four members of the band. They were only back in London for a funeral, booking this one-off show not to launch a comeback, but to say goodbye to the music they had left behind.

                                The lead singer stared at the sodas, then at her. "Are you taking the mickey?" He assumed she was mocking them—another industry suit flaunting a "clean" image.

                            As they talked, the pieces fell into place. Like Ryan and Cassidy, the Origin siblings were <strong>autistic</strong>.
