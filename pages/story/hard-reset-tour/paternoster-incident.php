                        We arrived at the Ministry building for the press junket at 8:00 AM. The promoter had promised "full accessibility." He lied.

                    <p class="text-dark">
                        The lobby was dominated by a <strong>Paternoster</strong>—a cyclic elevator with no doors, just a chain of open wooden boxes moving relentlessly upward. <em>Click-clack. Click-clack.</em> You had to hop on while it was moving.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-dark">
                        Ryan sat in his chair, staring at it. The lip of the compartment was ten inches high. The gap was narrow. If his caster wheels caught, the machine wouldn't stop; it would crush the chair—and him—against the ceiling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-dark mb-0">
                        "It's a meat grinder," Evan said, standing protectively between Ryan and the open shaft.

                        The locals joked that if you missed your floor and rode the box "over the top," the gears would grind you to dust. While technically a myth (it just loops safely), to a man paralyzed from the waist down, the threat felt very real. Ryan famously told the promoter: <strong>"I'm not rolling my life into a moving coffin."</strong>

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                There was no other elevator. The interview was on the 6th floor.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                Without a word, <strong>Tyler Wright</strong> handed his backpack to Holly. He grabbed the back handles of Ryan's chair. <strong>Evan Wright</strong> grabbed the front frame by the knees. They didn't ask for help. They simply tilted Ryan back forty-five degrees and began the climb up six flights of marble stairs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-5">
                Ryan did the interview sweating, still covered in the dust of the stairwell. When the journalist asked about his "glamorous rock star life," Ryan just laughed.

                        The hardest part of the 1998 tour wasn't the shows; it was the nights.

                        European hotel rooms were tiny. "Accessible" usually just meant the door was slightly wider. For the O'Connell siblings, this posed a logistical crisis. Privacy had died on I-81 in 1990. Ryan's care—intermittent catheterization, bowel management, skin checks—required assistance that only <strong>Cassidy</strong> and <strong>Holly</strong> were trusted to provide.

                    <p class="text-white-50">
                        They couldn't be in separate rooms. If Ryan had a dysreflexic episode at 3:00 AM, seconds mattered.

                            Holly's tour rider was non-negotiable: <strong>"One King Bed. Non-negotiable."</strong>

                            It became an autistic need for both Ryan and Cassidy—the sensory grounding of the "puppy pile." Ryan in the middle (where it was easiest to turn him), Cassidy on his left (her "Safe Side"), Holly on the right (closest to the medical bag). They slept tangled together, a protective knot of limbs that kept the world out and the "Engine" safe.
