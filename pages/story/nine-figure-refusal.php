                                Omni-Global Media proposed a complete buyout of the <strong>Engine Room Records</strong> master catalog. The deal included rights to all recordings from 1987 to 2017, including the <em>Warehouse Tapes</em> and <em>Knox</em>.

                                It was the "Golden Parachute." A chance for the O'Connell family to retire as multi-millionaires. Holly O'Connell (CEO) reviewed the initial contract but flagged a section titled "Asset Optimization." She brought the band to the headquarters to hear the pitch in person.

                                The deal-breaker wasn't the money. It was a single presentation slide detailing how the corporation planned to "maximize streaming revenue" for the 15-minute epic <em>Escape Velocity (Ad Astra)</em>. The executives argued that a prog-rock suite was "algorithmic poison" with a high skip rate. Their plan was to <strong>De-Couple</strong> the track into four separate streaming assets.

                                To Omni-Global, it was data. To Cassidy, <em>Ad Astra</em> was the literal mechanism she used to regulate her nervous system and process the trauma of 1992. The slide didn't just propose an edit; it proposed a lobotomy of her coping mechanism.

                                The realization triggered an immediate, severe autistic meltdown. A loud, guttural cry tore from her chest as she collapsed. Ryan moved instantly, catching her and pulling her into a tight, grounding embrace to shield her from the room.

                                Holly O'Connell didn't wait. She stood up and declared the meeting over, stating firmly that Engine Room Records was <strong>NOT</strong> for sale. Ryan, Tyler, and Evan fiercely agreed, physically blocking the executives from approaching.
