# The Stardust Engine

This repository contains the creative assets, narrative, and history for the fictional 1980s synth-rock band, **The Stardust Engine**.

This `README.md` details the *fictional narrative* of the band and its universe. The website's technical implementation is a separate project.

## The Band

The Stardust Engine is a family band, all alumni of Commonwealth Polytechnic Institute (CPI), Class of '89.

* **Ryan O'Connell:** Lead Vocals, Lead Guitar (The "Engine")
* **Cassidy O’Connell:** Lead Vocals, Piano, Synthesizers (The "Stardust")
* **Evan Wright:** Bass Guitar, Rhythm Guitar
* **Tyler Wright:** Drums, Percussion
* **Holly O’Connell:** Manager

## The Narrative

The band's history is defined by a "cold war" with their label, Apex Records. The studio attempted to market them with reductive "Stardust" (Cassidy's synth-pop) and "Engine" (Ryan's rock) personas, which the band hated. The band's true name was meant to represent their love of astronomy: the cosmos (Stardust) and the rockets that get you there (Engine).

This conflict culminated in the 1992 *Friction* album disaster, where a rogue executive, Julian Vance, made the fatal assumption that Ryan and Cassidy were a married couple, not siblings. This "nuke" event ultimately freed the band from their contract and allowed them to found their own label, **Engine Room Records, LLC**, funded by their loyal "Forger Nation" fanbase.
